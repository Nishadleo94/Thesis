Developing a Recommender System for Customers in a Scan and Go store using Apriori Algorithm in Market Basket Analysis


The aim of the research is to study the possible impact a recommender system can bring about in
increasing the revenue for a fully-automated Scan and Go store. The core of the research involves
building a recommender system for Customers Using Apriori Algorithm in Market Basket Analysis. This
data mining technique makes it possible to create an association between various products with the
help of historical transactional data. Once a customer shops an item, the related products could be
recommended to them.

Furthermore, the business aspect of introducing a recommender system is also studied. This involves
how the revenue can be improved while at the same time satisfying the customers. Basically, the
application of recommender system in a physical store is examined.

The secondary research involves the study of various published papers related to relevant topics such
as Market Basket Analysis, Recommender systems, Various association rules, use of big data, etc. The
knowledge obtained from these papers pave the way for the primary research analysis.

The primary research consists of executing the Market Basket Analysis in CRISP-DM methodology.
Further, people reactions to a fully-automated Scan and Go store is also analysed using online survey.
All the obtained results are visualised with the help of appropriate tools.

The question of how the recommender system improves the revenue of a company while making their
customers satisfied is tried to answer by in-depth analysis of results obtained from the primary
research and knowledge obtained from the secondary research
